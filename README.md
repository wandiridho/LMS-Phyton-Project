Library Management System Phyton Project
The Library Management System (LMS) seeks to modernize library book, user, and borrowing operation administration. As library operations expand, traditional hand-operated systems are prone to data loss, inefficiency, and trouble expanding. Using Python, this project develops an automated system with fundamental capabilities such book and user administration, role-based authentication, borrowing and returning books, and data storage via CSV files, thereby addressing these constraints. The system guarantees good performance even with bigger datasets by using effective algorithms such binary search for fast user locating and merge sort for book sorting. Exceptional handling is used to improve resilience and guarantee that the software elegantly manages faulty inputs and file faults without stopping. While members may browse for books, borrow currently available titles, and handle their profiles, administrators can add, edit, or delete books and users. Using many criteria, such as title or author, linear search lets one flexible inquiry of book data. Following object-oriented programming ideas, the modular design of the system guarantees scalability, maintainability, and code organization. This project shows how to provide dependable and effective answers for real-world issues by integrating theoretical ideas such algorithmic analysis, error handling, and data management into pragmatic application. The LMS lowers administrative work by effectively automating manual library activities, hence enhancing accuracy and user experience. Future improvements will include database connectivity and a graphical user interface to enable the system to be scaled for bigger libraries.

Functional Feature
1.	Admin Features: 
-	Add, change, and remove books.
-	Record users adding, updating, and deleting.
-	Sort all of books and users.
-	Control book borrowing and return policy.
2.	Member Features: 
-	Sort and look for books using author, title, book ID or stock
-	Borrow and return books.
-	Change profile data.
3.	System Features: 
-	Administrative and member users' role-based authentication.
-	Using CSV files, data persistence stores books, users, and borrowing data.
-	Arranging books according to qualities such title, stock, etc.

Non-Functional Feature
1.	Scalability: The system should manage a lot of users and books without compromising speed.
2.	Efficiency: Operations of sorting and searching have to be effective.
3.	Usability: The terminal-based interface of the system must to be straightforward and easy for usage.
4.	Security: Role-based access control meant to stop illegal activity.
5.	Reliability: Data has to be kept constantly and stay available even after systems restarts.
6.	Maintainability: Maintaining simplicity and scalability, the system should be built in modules to facilitate changes.
